# SceneSniffer Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: May 4, 2025

Thank you for using SceneSniffer, a Chrome extension designed to identify TV shows and movies from YouTube Shorts videos. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have regarding your data.

## 1. Information We Collect

SceneSniffer collects and processes only the minimum data necessary to provide its core functionality:

- **Google Gemini API Key**: You provide your personal Google Gemini API key which is required for the AI analysis functionality.
- **Current YouTube URL**: When you use the extension, we process the URL of the YouTube Shorts page you're visiting.
- **Video Content**: When you request identification of a video, we capture screenshots of the currently playing YouTube Shorts video.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to provide the SceneSniffer service:

- **Google Gemini API Key**: Your API key is used exclusively to authenticate requests to Google's Gemini API for video content analysis.
- **Video Content**: Screenshots are analyzed by Google's Gemini API to identify TV shows, movies, and specific episodes.
- **YouTube URLs**: These are processed locally to determine if the extension should be active on the current page.

## 3. Data Storage and Sharing

- **Local Storage**: Your API key is stored locally in your browser's secure storage. It never leaves your device except when used to authenticate with Google's Gemini API.
- **No Data Retention**: We do not maintain servers that store your data. Video screenshots are sent directly to Google's Gemini API and are not stored by us.
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share any of your data with third parties. The only external service we interact with is Google's Gemini API when processing your identification requests.

## 4. Your Controls and Choices

You maintain full control over your data:

- You can remove your API key at any time through the extension's interface.
- You can uninstall the extension, which will remove all locally stored data.
- All processing occurs only when you explicitly click to identify a video.

## 5. Security

We take security seriously:

- Your API key is stored locally using Chrome's secure storage mechanisms.
- Communication with Google's Gemini API occurs over encrypted HTTPS connections.
- We do not maintain any servers that could be compromised to access your data.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting.

## 7. Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us:

## 8. Google Gemini API Terms

By using SceneSniffer, you acknowledge that the video content you analyze will be processed by Google's Gemini API, which is subject to [Google's own privacy policy and terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms). We have no control over how Google processes or stores data you submit through their API.
